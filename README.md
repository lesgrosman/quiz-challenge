**Note**: Strongly suggestion to use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (NVM) to make sure you are using the intended version of Node for this project.

1. With NVM installed, ensure you are using the correct Node version:

```sh
nvm use
```

2. Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and populate with values for local development:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```
